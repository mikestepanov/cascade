## 🔥 Key Features Explained

### Real-time Collaboration
All changes are synchronized in real-time using Convex's reactive database. When multiple users edit the same document or move issues on a Kanban board, everyone sees the changes instantly.

### Presence System
The presence system shows:
- Who's currently viewing each document (facepile)
- Live cursor positions in documents
- Active users in projects

### Document Linking
Documents can be linked to projects and issues, creating a knowledge base that's directly connected to your work items.

### Workflow Customization
Each project can have custom workflow states beyond the default (To Do → In Progress → Review → Done).

\`\`\`bash
# Development
pnpm run dev              # Start dev server with hot reload
