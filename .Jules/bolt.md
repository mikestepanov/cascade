## 2024-05-24 - Soft Delete Performance Optimization
**Learning:** Convex indexes require `isDeleted` (or equivalent) to be explicitly included in the index fields to allow efficient filtering of active items at the database level. Using `.filter(notDeleted)` without index support causes full scans of all items matching other criteria, which degrades performance as the number of soft-deleted items grows.
**Action:** Always include `isDeleted` in indexes used for listing "active" items, especially for high-cardinality collections like Issues. Use `.lt("isDeleted", true)` range query to efficiently select active items (where `isDeleted` is `undefined`) while preserving sort order by creation time (implicit tie-breaker).
