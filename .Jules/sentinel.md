## 2024-05-23 - CSRF Bypass via x-api-key Header
**Vulnerability:** The CSRF middleware allowed bypassing CSRF validation if the `x-api-key` header was present, regardless of whether the request also contained session cookies.
**Learning:** Middleware logic that skips checks based on headers must verify that the skipped check's protection isn't needed. In this case, `x-api-key` implies "API client", but browsers can also send this header (if CORS allows or via XSS), while still sending cookies. This allowed attackers to use cookie-based authentication while bypassing CSRF by injecting a fake header.
**Prevention:** Logic was added to ensure that the `x-api-key` bypass ONLY applies if no authentication cookies (`access_token`, `session_id`) are present. If cookies are present, CSRF is enforced regardless of headers.

## 2024-05-24 - Timing Attack via Authentication Flow
**Vulnerability:** The login flow returned significantly faster for non-existent users compared to existing users with incorrect passwords (due to skipping the expensive bcrypt comparison).
**Learning:** Early returns in authentication logic, especially before expensive operations like hashing, leak state information. Attackers can use this time difference to enumerate valid email addresses.
**Prevention:** Implemented a constant-time comparison strategy using a dummy bcrypt hash. The authentication service now performs a hash comparison in all failure paths, ensuring response times are indistinguishable regardless of user existence.

## 2025-05-25 - Denial of Service via Memory Buffering in S3 Uploads
**Vulnerability:** The `S3StorageAdapter` was buffering entire file streams into memory (`chunks.push(chunk)`) before uploading to S3. This allowed an attacker to trigger an Out-Of-Memory (OOM) crash by uploading a large file (e.g., 5GB video), causing a Denial of Service.
**Learning:** Using `Buffer.concat` on streams without size limits is dangerous. Node.js processes have limited memory (default ~2GB). Always assume streams can exceed available memory.
**Prevention:** Refactored the upload logic to use `@aws-sdk/lib-storage`'s `Upload` class, which streams data directly to S3 using multipart uploads. Added a `PassThrough` stream to track file size without buffering.

## 2025-05-26 - Email Verification Persistence on Change
**Vulnerability:** Users could change their email address in `updateProfile` without losing their `emailVerificationTime` status. This allowed a verified user to claim any email address (including unowned ones) while appearing "verified" to the system.
**Learning:** When allowing updates to sensitive identity fields (email, phone), simply validating the format or uniqueness is insufficient. You must also reset any associated trust markers (verification timestamps).
**Prevention:** Always couple identity updates with a reset of verification state. Added logic to explicitly set `emailVerificationTime` to `undefined` when the email field changes.

## 2025-05-27 - Project Creation IDOR via Missing Hierarchy Checks
**Vulnerability:** The `createProject` mutation accepted `organizationId` and `workspaceId` arguments without verifying the caller's membership in those resources. This allowed any authenticated user to create projects in any organization or workspace by guessing their IDs.
**Learning:** Relying on `authenticatedMutation` is insufficient for resource creation. You must explicitly verify that the user has write/admin permissions on the *parent* container (Organization/Workspace) where the new resource is being created.
**Prevention:** Added explicit `getOrganizationRole` and `getWorkspaceRole` checks in the mutation handler to ensure the caller is an organization admin or workspace member.

## 2025-05-28 - Secure E2E Testing Pattern
**Vulnerability:** Concern about `testOtpCodes` storing plaintext OTPs.
**Learning:** The project uses a dedicated table `testOtpCodes` for E2E tests, separate from `authVerificationCodes` (hashed). Writes are strictly limited to `@inbox.mailtrap.io` emails via `isTestEmail` check in `OTPVerification.ts`. Read access via `/e2e/get-latest-otp` is protected by `validateE2EApiKey` which enforces an API key or Development environment.
**Prevention:** Maintain this strict separation. Ensure `validateE2EApiKey` continues to fail secure if no API key is configured in non-dev environments.
