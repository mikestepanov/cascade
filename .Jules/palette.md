## 2024-05-22 - Improving Tooltip Flexibility
**Learning:** The Base UI `Tooltip.Trigger` renders a `button` by default, which can lead to invalid HTML when nested inside other interactive elements like `label` (used in file inputs).
**Action:** Modified `SDSTooltip` to accept a `renderTrigger` prop, allowing the use of `div` or other elements as triggers when necessary. This pattern should be used whenever a tooltip is needed on an element that cannot contain a button.

## 2024-05-23 - Keeping Completed Items Focusable
**Learning:** Disabling buttons for "completed" steps removes them from the tab order, making them invisible to keyboard and screen reader users. Users can't perceive that a task was already completed.
**Action:** Instead of using the native `disabled` attribute, use `aria-disabled="true"` and a descriptive `aria-label` (e.g., "Complete profile, Completed"). Ensure visual styling matches the disabled state (e.g., `cursor: default`) while keeping the element interactive or at least focusable.

## 2026-01-14 - SDSIcon Accessibility on Links
**Learning:** When `SDSIcon` is used as a link (with `href`), the underlying `SDSPrimitiveButton` fails to pass standard HTML attributes (like `aria-label`) to the anchor tag.
**Action:** Use the `ariaLabel` (camelCase) prop on `SDSIcon`. This prop is explicitly handled to apply `aria-label` and `role="img"` to the inner icon element, ensuring accessible names are preserved even when the outer link wrapper drops attributes.

## 2026-01-15 - SDSIcon Nesting & Semantics
**Learning:** `SDSIcon` renders a `<button>` by default. When used inside another interactive element (like `SDSMenu` trigger) or as a non-interactive indicator (like "5 likes"), this creates invalid HTML (nested buttons) or misleading semantics.
**Action:** Always use `isIconOnly` prop on `SDSIcon` when:
1. It is nested inside another button/trigger.
2. It is purely decorative or informational (not clickable).

## 2026-01-24 - Icon-only SDSButtons must have ariaLabel
**Learning:** Developers use `text=""` on `SDSButton` to create icon-only buttons but often forget `ariaLabel`, leaving the button inaccessible.
**Action:** When using `SDSButton` with empty text for icon-only usage, always enforce `ariaLabel`. Ideally, prefer `SDSIconButton` which enforces `ariaLabel` via types.

## 2026-02-18 - Replacing Native Title with Tooltips
**Learning:** Native `title` attributes are problematic for accessibility (inconsistent screen reader support, no mobile support) and UX (delayed appearance, default styling).
**Action:** Replace `title` attributes on interactive elements with the `Tooltip` component. When doing so on icon-only buttons, ensure an explicit `aria-label` is added if the button relies on the `title` for its accessible name. Update tests to query by accessible name (`getByRole('button', { name: '...' })`) instead of `getByTitle`.

## 2026-02-05 - Fixing Nested Interactive Controls
**Learning:** Found a pattern where interactive elements (e.g., delete buttons) were nested inside a clickable container implemented as a `<button>`. This is invalid HTML and breaks screen reader navigation.
**Action:** When creating complex list items with multiple actions, use a `div` or `li` container. Wrap the main content area in a `Link` or `button`, and keep secondary actions as siblings, using absolute positioning or flexbox to maintain the visual layout.
