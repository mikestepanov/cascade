  "body": "🚨 Severity: HIGH\n💡 Vulnerability: Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) in `getProjectContext`.\n🎯 Impact: Unauthorized users could retrieve sensitive project information (sprints, issue stats) by manipulating the `projectId` passed to the AI chat.\n🔧 Fix: Updated `convex/internal/ai.ts` to require `userId` and use `assertCanAccessProject` to verify permissions before returning context.\n✅ Verification: Ran updated tests in `convex/internal/ai.test.ts` which now includes a test case for unauthorized access.\n\n---\n*PR created automatically by Jules for task [18083600182291721379](https://jules.google.com/task/18083600182291721379) started by @mikestepanov*\n\n<!-- This is an auto-generated comment: release notes by coderabbit.ai -->\n## Summary by CodeRabbit\n\n* **New Features**\n  * Project context retrieval now requires a user identity; requests without matching user access will error.\n\n* **Accessibility**\n  * Calendar day cells are keyboard-focusable and exposed as interactive elements.\n\n* **Tests**\n  * Tests updated to cover user-scoped project access and unauthorized access denial; several tests were renamed, removed, or consolidated with shared mock helpers.\n\n* **Chores**\n  * Linting/formatting and validation scripts refined for clearer rules and safer output handling.\n\n<sub>✏️ Tip: You can customize this high-level summary in your review settings.</sub>\n<!-- end of auto-generated comment: release notes by coderabbit.ai -->",
