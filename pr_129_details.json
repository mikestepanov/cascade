  "body": "⚡ **Bolt Optimization**\n\n**What:**\nReplaced the client-side (server function side) counting logic which fetched up to 2,000 documents with the native `db.count()` method.\n\n**Why:**\nPreviously, to count issues (e.g., \"Todo: 1542\"), the backend would fetch 2,000 documents from the database, deserialize them, and then check the array length. This is O(N) in terms of data transfer and memory.\nUsing `db.count()` is O(1) or optimized O(N) index scan on the database server without transferring document data.\n\n**Impact:**\n- Significantly reduces memory usage and execution time for projects with many issues.\n- Removes the arbitrary 2,000 issue count limit (users now see the real total).\n- Maintains compatibility with existing tests via the `efficientCount` fallback.\n\n**Verification:**\n- Ran `pnpm test:convex` to ensure no regressions in existing tests.\n- Verified that `efficientCount` correctly falls back to legacy behavior in the test environment (which lacks `.count()` support).\n\n---\n*PR created automatically by Jules for task [13859714862943799081](https://jules.google.com/task/13859714862943799081) started by @mikestepanov*\n\n<!-- This is an auto-generated comment: release notes by coderabbit.ai -->\n\n## Summary by CodeRabbit\n\n* **Refactor**\n  * Improved issue counting performance and accuracy by removing the 2000-item limit previously applied to issue counts across teams, projects, sprints, and roadmaps. Issue counts are now computed more efficiently.\n\n<sub>✏️ Tip: You can customize this high-level summary in your review settings.</sub>\n\n<!-- end of auto-generated comment: release notes by coderabbit.ai -->",
