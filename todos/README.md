## How to Use

1. **Pick a feature** from the table above
2. **Read the full spec** - understand the problem, implementation, and acceptance criteria
3. **Work through tasks sequentially** - each spec is ordered by dependency
4. **Check off tasks** as you complete them
5. **Update the spec** if you discover new requirements or edge cases
