- All major platforms supported
- Enterprise-grade reliability

## Cons ❌

- Costs add up at scale ($0.50/hr = $500/1000 hrs)

## Nixelo Strategy

Best for Nixelo's "Cloud" tier to offer meeting intelligence without maintaining a bot fleet. Too expensive for self-hosted users unless they bring their own key.
