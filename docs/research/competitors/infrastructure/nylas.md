## Overview

**Nylas** provides universal APIs for email, calendar, and contacts. They recently added **communications intelligence** and **meeting bots** (via acquisition/partnership strategies) to their suite.

## Features

- **Email API:** Universal IMAP/Exchange/Gmail wrapper.
- **Calendar API:** Bi-directional sync for Google/Outlook/Apple.
- **Scheduler:** Built-in scheduling UI (Cal.com competitor).
- **Communication Intelligence:** Extract clean text from emails/meetings.

## Strengths ✅

- **Developer Experience:** Excellent SDKs and documentation.
- **Reliability:** Public company scale (recently IPO'd or near it).
- **Broad Suite:** Solve Email + Calendar + Meetings in one vendor.

## Weaknesses ❌

- **Cost:** generally usage-based but can get pricey.
- **Meeting Bot Maturity:** Their real-time meeting bot offering is newer compared to Recall.ai's dedicated focus.

## Nixelo Strategy

Useful reference for Nixelo's _Calendar Integration_ strategy. We might compete with their Scheduler, but could potentially use them as an infrastructure provider if self-hosting integration logic becomes too complex.
