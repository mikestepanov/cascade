## Overview

**Skribby** is a developer-first meeting bot API targeting indie hackers, early-stage startups, and cost-conscious teams building meeting intelligence features. The platform competes directly with Recall.ai but differentiates on simplicity, transparent pricing, and transcription provider flexibility. At $0.35/hour with no contracts, platform fees, or minimums, Skribby is the most affordable proprietary meeting bot API in the market.

Skribby supports Zoom, Microsoft Teams, and Google Meet through a single REST API, with bots deployable in as little as 5 minutes. A key differentiator is the support for 10+ transcription providers (including Whisper, Deepgram, and AssemblyAI), allowing developers to optimize for accuracy, cost, or language support based on their specific use case. In independent side-by-side tests, Skribby delivered transcripts 6x faster and cost 31% less than Meeting BaaS for equivalent usage patterns.

## Pricing

| Component | Cost | Details |
|-----------|------|---------|
| **Recording + Transcription** | $0.35/hour | All-inclusive, per-minute billing |
| **Free Trial** | 5 hours | No credit card required |
| **Contracts** | None | Pay-as-you-go only |
| **Minimums** | None | No monthly minimum spend |
| **Platform Fees** | None | No additional base fees |
| **Volume Discounts** | Available | Contact for high-volume pricing |

### Pricing Analysis

Skribby is the most affordable proprietary option in the meeting bot API space. At $0.35/hour all-in, it is approximately 46% cheaper than Recall.ai (~$0.65/hour with transcription) and 49% cheaper than Meeting BaaS's hosted option ($0.69/hour). The pricing includes bot deployment, raw audio recording, and live webhook notifications, all billed per active minute. For a startup processing 500 hours of meetings per month, Skribby would cost approximately $175/month compared to $325 with Recall.ai or $345 with Meeting BaaS hosted. The 5-hour free trial with no credit card requirement lowers the barrier to evaluation. Volume discounts are available for high-volume customers but require direct contact.

## Strengths

1. **Most Affordable:** At $0.35/hour all-in with no platform fees, contracts, or minimums, Skribby is the cheapest proprietary meeting bot API available.
2. **Transcription Flexibility:** 10+ transcription model options (Whisper, Deepgram, AssemblyAI) with bring-your-own-credentials; no other provider offers this breadth.
3. **Simplicity:** Less "enterprise bloat" than larger providers; minimal API surface area means faster integration and fewer abstractions to learn.
4. **Fast Transcript Delivery:** 6x faster transcript delivery than Meeting BaaS in independent side-by-side testing.
5. **Low Barrier to Entry:** 5-hour free trial with no credit card, GitHub/Google login, and API key generation in minutes.
6. **Active Community:** Fast support response times and active Discord community for developer assistance.

---

## Weaknesses

1. **Limited Platform Coverage:** Only supports Zoom, Teams, and Google Meet; missing Webex, Slack Huddles, and GoTo Meeting that Recall.ai covers.
2. **No SDK:** No official SDK currently available; developers must use REST API directly (though OpenAPI spec allows client generation).
3. **Startup Risk:** Smaller company with less funding and fewer enterprise customers than Recall.ai ($51M funded, 300+ clients).
4. **No Compliance Certifications:** Lacks SOC2, HIPAA, and ISO 27001 certifications required by enterprise and healthcare customers.
5. **Feature Depth:** Fewer advanced features compared to enterprise platforms; no speaking bot, output media, or desktop recording SDK.
6. **Documentation Maturity:** Less comprehensive documentation and fewer integration guides compared to Recall.ai.

### Data Handling
- **Authentication:** Bearer token via API key + OAuth for auth accounts
- **OAuth Integration:** OAuth-based auth accounts for joining private meetings in regulated fields
- **Storage:** Secure meeting recording storage with flexible retention and easy retrieval
- **API Keys:** Generated via Dashboard with GitHub or Google login
- **Encryption:** Standard HTTPS for API communication
- **Private Meetings:** OAuth auth accounts enable compliance in regulated environments (e.g., healthcare access, though not HIPAA certified)

## Nixelo vs Skribby

| Dimension | Nixelo | Skribby |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| **Primary Function** | Project management + Voice AI | Meeting bot API |
| **Relationship** | Potential customer | Infrastructure provider |
| **Meeting Platforms** | Via Recall.ai (6 platforms) | Zoom, Teams, Meet (3 platforms) |
| **AI Processing** | Text AI, Voice AI, action items | Raw recording + transcription |
| **Transcription** | Via Recall.ai built-in | 10+ model options with BYO creds |
| **Calendar** | Google Calendar sync | No calendar features |
| **Target User** | End-user teams | Developer teams / startups |
| **Compliance** | Inherits from Convex + Recall.ai | No formal certifications |
| **Pricing** | Platform subscription | $0.35/hour usage-based |

---

## Key Takeaways

### What to Learn
- **Transcription provider flexibility:** Offering 10+ transcription models with bring-your-own-credentials is a powerful developer feature; Nixelo could expose similar flexibility to let users choose accuracy vs. cost tradeoffs.
- **Transparent pricing:** No hidden fees, no contracts, no minimums builds trust with developer audiences; apply similar transparency to Nixelo's Voice AI pricing tier.
- **Fast time-to-value:** 5-minute deployment with free trial and no credit card is a benchmark for developer onboarding; Nixelo should aim for equally frictionless bot-service setup.
- **Silence detection and auto-stop:** Smart stop conditions prevent billing for idle meetings; implement similar controls in Nixelo's Voice AI to optimize costs.

### What to Avoid
- **Lack of compliance certifications:** Enterprise and healthcare customers cannot evaluate Skribby without SOC2/HIPAA; this limits its addressable market severely.
- **No SDK strategy:** Relying solely on REST API without an SDK increases integration friction; provide both.
- **Narrow platform coverage:** Supporting only 3 platforms misses enterprise use cases (Webex, Slack Huddles) that Recall.ai handles.
- **Startup dependency risk:** Building critical infrastructure on a small, unfunded startup carries significant platform risk.

## Nixelo Integration Strategy

Skribby is a potential **backup provider** if Recall.ai becomes too expensive, but Meeting BaaS is likely a better "low-cost" alignment since it allows self-hosting which fits Nixelo's architecture:

1. **Current Position:** Skribby is not integrated with Nixelo. Recall.ai is the primary provider and Meeting BaaS is the preferred secondary option for self-hosted deployments.
2. **Cost Savings Scenario:** If Nixelo's meeting volume grows significantly and Recall.ai pricing becomes prohibitive, Skribby at $0.35/hour (46% cheaper) could serve as a cost-optimization provider for non-enterprise tiers.
3. **Transcription Flexibility:** Skribby's 10+ transcription model options could benefit Nixelo users who need specialized language support or want to bring their own transcription credentials for cost control.
4. **Evaluation Criteria:** Before adopting Skribby, Nixelo should evaluate: (a) company stability and funding status, (b) SOC2 certification timeline, (c) SDK availability, and (d) platform coverage expansion plans.
5. **Architecture Consideration:** Nixelo's bot-service abstraction layer should support multiple providers; Skribby's REST API simplicity would make it the easiest secondary provider to integrate after Meeting BaaS.

---

## Verdict

Skribby fills a clear niche as the most affordable and developer-friendly meeting bot API, with standout transcription provider flexibility (10+ models with BYO credentials) and impressively fast transcript delivery. However, the lack of compliance certifications, limited platform coverage (3 vs. Recall.ai's 6), and startup risk profile make it unsuitable as Nixelo's primary infrastructure provider. **Recommendation:** Monitor Skribby's growth, compliance certification progress, and funding status. Consider as a tertiary provider option if cost optimization becomes critical, but prioritize Recall.ai (enterprise/cloud) and Meeting BaaS (self-hosted) as the primary and secondary providers respectively. The transcription provider flexibility concept is worth adopting in Nixelo's own Voice AI architecture regardless of which bot provider is used.
