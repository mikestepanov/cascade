---

## Overview

**Skribby** is a smaller, developer-focused player in the "Meeting Bot API" space, competing directly with Recall.ai but often targeting indie hackers or smaller startups.

## Pricing

- Positioned as a "simpler, cheaper" alternative to Recall.ai.
- Often has lower monthly minimums.

## Features

- Recording & Transcription bots.
- Webhook events.
- Simple REST API.

## Pros ✅

- **Simplicity:** Less "Enterprise Bloat" than the bigger players.
- **Cost:** Accessible for early-stage startups.

## Cons ❌

- **Proven Scale:** Documentation not as robust as Recall.ai.
- **Longevity:** A smaller startup carries more platform risk.

## Nixelo Strategy

A potential backup provider if Recall.ai becomes too expensive, but **Meeting BaaS** is likely a better "low cost" alignment since it allows self-hosting which fits Nixelo's open-source ethos better.
