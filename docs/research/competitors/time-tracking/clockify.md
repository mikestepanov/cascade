# Competitor Analysis: Clockify

> **Focus:** Free & "Good Enough"
> **Vibe:** "Corporate Timesheet" - The Spreadsheet Killer.

## 1. Deep Dive: Clockify (The "Good Enough" Standard)

**Why it wins:** It's free (mostly) and "good enough" for 90% of teams. Unlimited users on free tier.
**Weakness:** UI is clunky, feels like a spreadsheet. "Spy" features are limited compared to others.

### "Scrappable" Features

- **Auto-Tracker:** Desktop app records window titles (private to user) and lets them bulk-convert to time entries later.
- **Kiosk Mode:** Shared tablet for clocking in with a PIN code (great for hybrid offices).
- **Idle Detection:** Simple pop-up "Are you there?" when no mouse/keyboard activity.
