# Competitor Analysis: Jibble

> **Focus:** Physical Accountability & Biometrics
> **Vibe:** "Construction/Field" - You _must_ be there.

## 1. Feature Scraping Matrix

| Feature        | Why it's useful                                        | Nixelo's "Configurable Edge"                                                                     |
| :------------- | :----------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Speed Mode** | Face recognition clock-in. Prevents buddy punching.    | **"Proof of Presence":** Optional module for high-trust verification (e.g., remote contractors). |
| **Geofencing** | Restrict clock-in to specific locations (office/site). | **"Location Context":** "You are at the Office. Switch to 'Office' profile?"                     |

## 2. Deep Dive: Jibble (The "Hard" Tracker)

**Why it wins:** Physical accountability. Prevents buddy punching in high-trust or hourly environments.
**Weakness:** Too aggressive for knowledge workers/devs. Can feel distrustful.

### Technical Implementation

- **Biometrics:** Uses device camera for facial recognition comparison.
- **GPS:** Mobile-first approach for geofencing.
