## Overview

**Notion** started as a documentation tool and evolved into a "LEGO set" for building your own workflows. It is a major indirect competitor because many startups use it for everything.

## Pricing

- **Free:** Collaborative for individuals, limited for teams.
- **Plus:** ~$8/user/mo (Unlimited blocks, file uploads).
- **Business:** ~$15/user/mo (SAML SSO, private teamspaces).
- **Notion AI:** Add-on ~$8/user/mo.

## Features

- **Pages & Blocks:** The core primitive; everything is a block.
- **Databases:** Flexible tables with relational capabilities (Relations, Rollups).
- **Views:** Board, Calendar, Gallery, List, Timeline views of databases.
- **Wiki:** Best-in-class knowledge base capabilities.

## Strengths ✅

- **flexibility:** You can build _exactly_ the process you want.
- **Docs:** The best writing experience in the market.
- **Adoption:** Massive community and template ecosystem.

## Weaknesses ❌

- **Not a PM Tool:** "Project Management" is just a template; lacks specialized features (Sprints, Burndowns, Git sync are weak/manual).
- **Performance:** Can get very slow with large databases.
- **Offline:** Poor offline support.

## Nixelo Strategy

**"Notion for Docs, Linear for Issues."**
Nixelo combines the best of Notion (integrated docs) with the structure/speed of Linear. Users shouldn't have to "build" their PM tool in Notion.
