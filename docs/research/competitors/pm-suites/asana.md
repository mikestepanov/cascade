---

## Overview

**Asana** is a veteran work management platform focused on team collaboration, accountability, and clarity. It is less "developer-centric" than Jira/Linear and more "business-centric."

## Pricing

- **Personal:** Free (up to 10 users, limited).
- **Starter:** ~$11/user/mo.
- **Advanced:** ~$25/user/mo (Goals, Portfolios).
- **Enterprise:** Custom.

## Features

- **Projects & Tasks:** List, Board, Timeline, Calendar views.
- **Portfolios:** High-level view of multiple projects (Advanced tier).
- **Goals:** OKR tracking integrated with work.
- **Workload:** Resource management and capacity planning.
- **Rules:** automation builder.

## Strengths ✅

- **Clarity:** Excellent UI for seeing "who is doing what by when."
- **Adoption:** Easy for non-technical teams (Marketing, HR, Ops) to pick up.
- **Visuals:** Great Timeline and Workload views.

## Weaknesses ❌

- **Pricing:** Expensive compared to others ($25 for decent features).
- **Not for Devs:** Lacks deep code integration (Git, PRs) compared to Jira/Linear.
- **No Docs:** No built-in wiki/docs feature (relies on descriptions or external tools).

## Nixelo Strategy

Target Asana's technical users who feel constrained. Asana is great for marketing; Nixelo is for builders who need deep code integration + docs.
