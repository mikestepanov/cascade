## 1. Feature Scraping Matrix

| Feature                  | Why it's useful                                  | Nixelo's "Configurable Edge"                                                        |
| :----------------------- | :----------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Keyboard Shortcuts**   | Speed. `C` for create, `K` for command.          | **"Vim Mode":** Allow `j/k` navigation but make it toggleable for non-devs.         |
| **Optimistic UI**        | "Instant" feel even on slow networks.            | **"Convergent Sync":** Show local state immediately, sync in background via Convex. |
| **Cycles (Not Sprints)** | "Sprint" implies crunch. "Cycle" implies rhythm. | **"Sprints":** Keep the industry standard naming but copy the auto-rollover logic.  |
